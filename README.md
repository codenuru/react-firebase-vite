> Next Generation Boilerplate for React/Typescript, built on top of Vite ‚ö°Ô∏è

The goal of the project is to create a web application that allows the user to create, view, edit and delete data from a table. The project uses React, ViteJS, CSS3 and TypeScript along with Firebase to store and retrieve data. The application is responsive, using media queries to adjust the layout to different screen sizes. The app has two color modes using media queries to adjust the color for different user color configurations.
